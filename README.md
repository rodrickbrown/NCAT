Linux Challenge

Instructions to find the 3 keys.

Key 1
Find and unzip “Key1.zip” (Password will be required to unzip the folder, instructions below to find out the password). Open Key1.txt to get the key

The password is the sum of the following two values:


a)	total number of files in the "linux game" directory (inc. sub directories)
b)	number of .txt files in “Linux Challenge” directory (inc. sub directories) that contain the word “Meta” in the file name (not in the file itself)

Key 2
Find and unzip “Key2.zip” (Password will be required to unzip the folder, instructions below to find out the password). Open Key2.txt to get the key

To get the password:

Find Profile 1.txt and Profile 2.txt and open them to find some social media data for each profile. 

Compare the total number of instagram followers added in these 28 days. How many more followers has Profile 1 added compared to Profile 2, the answer is the password. (HINT - interestingly their daily social media stats seem to be exactly the same every day apart from the number of instagram followers they receive each day, even then, some days they seem to add the exact same number of followers.....)

Key 3
Find and unzip “Key3.zip” (Password will be required to unzip the folder, instructions below to find out the password). Open Key3.txt to get the key

To get the password find Password.txt and extract the 2nd and 9th character of each line in Password.txt
